# hello-world
This is my first repository, i'm following the hello world tutorial and will see what I come out with!

Hello everybody,

My name is Joanne Olayinka Adeluola, I am a chemistry student at the University of Birmingham and i'm currently in my second year. I live in Harbourne with another of my course mates and I absolutely love it here! My family are originally from Nigeria, and my mum stays in London. I spend my holidays with her in London, and all of my friends are in London too! I'ts pretty amazing, especially at Christmas because there are loads of funfairs that I can go to.
